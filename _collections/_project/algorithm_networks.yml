abstract: Study of Multiplex networks is gaining in importance in the field of net- work analysis. These consist of different sets of edges defined on the same set of nodes. Some popular domains in which multiplex networks arise are in transportation networks, online social media, and bibliographic networks. There is yet another direction of research that is beginning to become popular modeling super-dyadic or multi-way relations. It is well understood that the dynamics in a group setting are different as opposed to one-on-one interactions. Such multi-way interaction arise often in collaboration networks and when studying interaction dynamics in committees.The larger agenda that we want to pursue as part of this project is the analysis of multiplex hypergraph networks, combining both the streams of work above. In particular, we wish to conduct basic research in this topic along two directions - 1) we extend existing work on analyzing networks to the hypergraph context, by exploring different mechanisms for constructing equivalent normal graphs; and 2) we explore the construction of hypergraphs for attribute descriptions of data and the use of multiplex hypergraph networks in collective learning setting. In particular we work on developing applications on bibliographic network analysis using multiplex hypergraph models and develop algorithms that are relevant to the bibliographic domain and possibly relevant elsewhere. Given a seed paper or a set of query phrases, trace the relevant papers for the query. This is done through an interactive process where in a combination of the content of the papers as well as the network structure is used to narrow down on a set of useful papers to cite/read.
