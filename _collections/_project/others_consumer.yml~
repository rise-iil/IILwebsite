  abstract: We propose to explore several problems in the space of consumer behaviour analytic. We will endeavour to develop solutions that are deployable in a cloud or virtual environment. This is to enable integration with other Ericsson projects and tools if required. The intent is to develop scalable algorithms deployable on the cloud as well as on traditional high performance computing platforms leveraging our prior expertise in high performance data mining and machine learning.

  abstract: Community detection and structural role detection are two distinct but closely-related perspectives in network analytic. From the aspect of telecom consumer behavior analytics, community detection finds subgroups of users that are in frequent communication with one another, and structural role detection identifies users of various functionalities (for example, bridge, hub, periphery, etc.) in the network. Prior work has revealed the effectiveness using community/role detection in network science, and we will investigate the utility of such behavioral analytical tools in telecom industry applications such as churn prediction and influence propagation modeling.

  sub domain:
  abstract: Network motifs are statistically significant subgraphs, which occur frequently in the original network as compared to randomized networks. Quantifying the significance of motifs varies from application to application. Nonetheless, mining network motifs forms the backbone of various applications such as analyzing human interactions in call graph network, network classification, spam detection, protein-protein link prediction, prediction of susceptibility to cancer, and study of brain networks. These studies are done on static networks but real word communication networks are dynamic in nature. The goal of the work would be to develop our work on temporal motif mining to detecting significant temporal signatures indicating interesting events happening in the communication network. We will validate this work on telecom call graphs and other interaction networks and look to correlate to external events of interest.

  sub domain:
  abstract: A business has a competitive edge if one can predict “customer event” before it happens and provide proactive assistance to an aggrieved customer. A variety of information is available for building such predictive model. The key difficulty is to be able to do the information integration in the few seconds, or at worst a minute, from a customer’s call to a representative answering the call. This would require some amount of judicious pre-processing of data and a good predictive model of when such calls would come in.
