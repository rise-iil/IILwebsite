abstract: A business has a competitive edge if one can predict “customer event” before it happens and provide proactive assistance to an aggrieved customer. A variety of information is available for building such predictive model. The key difficulty is to be able to do the information integration in the few seconds, or at worst a minute, from a customer’s call to a representative answering the call. This would require some amount of judicious pre-processing of data and a good predictive model of when such calls would come in.
