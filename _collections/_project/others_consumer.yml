abstract: We propose to explore several problems in the space of consumer behaviour analytic. We will endeavour to develop solutions that are deployable in a cloud or virtual environment. This is to enable integration with other Ericsson projects and tools if required. The intent is to develop scalable algorithms deployable on the cloud as well as on traditional high performance computing platforms leveraging our prior expertise in high performance data mining and machine learning.
