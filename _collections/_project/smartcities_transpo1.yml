abstract:With the increased success of Deep Learning techniques in visual systems, there has been Deep Learning works specific to the areas of interest for Autonomous Driver Assist Systems (ADAS). These include vehicle detection, vehicle tracking, pedestrian detection, lane detection, semantic segmentation etc. In the project we explore the use of convolutional neural networks in detection, classification and semantic segmentation in the context of ADAS. We propose to extend image based algorithms to videos and eventually look to explore efficient implementations on DSP processors.
