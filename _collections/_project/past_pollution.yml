abstract: The issue of Electromagnetic Radiation emitted from cell-phone towers and mobile handsets in the non-ionizing band has got considerable attention in recent times. Though there are several studies and measurement exercises undertaken to get an understanding of the situation, they have not been able to give a complete picture of the scenario. This project will employ a novel approach in order to get insight into the Electromagnetic emissions experienced by the public.  It will make use of considerable amount of data available from the existing handsets and base stations which are deployed and used across the country. This data include the signal power seen at a particular location from different operators in the vicinity. Very reliable statistical distributions will be arrived at by collecting electromagnetic levels seen by the millions of handsets and performing a big data analysis of the same. This will help in arriving at patterns of electromagnetic radiation in a geographical region which can in turn help in classifying areas and identifying any alarm zones. The analysis thus done will be augmented by simulation studies and measurements in the field.
